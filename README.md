- 👋 Hi, I’m @MisterProtocol.
- 👀 I’m working on resurrecting the RAND editor, variously know over time as ned, re, and finally "e".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub, God help me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... hmmm ... well, I'd welcome help with "e", for sure, but boy would I be surprised!
- 📫 How to reach me: mikeobrien@spamcop.net.
